So I've recently thought that it would be cool to grow something, so today I took the plunge and drive to the local Bunnings and picked up a few pots, some Chili seeds, Oregano seeds and a Strawberry plant.

Let's see how this goes. It's been a while since I've tried to grow anything, and in the past I think I might have committed major Herbicide, especially if I forget to water the damn things.

I'll continue to report in on how these bad boys grow.
